# Snake Game in React and TypeScript

Link to the game: [https://main--visionary-begonia-db2ace.netlify.app/](https://main--visionary-begonia-db2ace.netlify.app/)

After going through this [snake game tutorial by freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyhzCBEGaBY) and developing the game as they did in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I wanted to rebuild it in React.

Aside from rewriting the base project in React. I add some extra features:

- Multiple color themes to pick from
- allow user to customize the the game speed delay
- Mobile controls
  - Start button on screen
  - Swipe to control direction of snake.

More features that could be added

- Persist high score through local storage
- allow user to turn off increasing speed
- Pause Feature
