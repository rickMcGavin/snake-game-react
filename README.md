# Snake Game in React and TypeScript

After going through this [snake game tutorial by freeCodeCamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyhzCBEGaBY) and [OG Course Link before FCC](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkXqOdpo5ul8BosGBFlDgmw) developing the game as they did in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, why not see if I could build the game in React?

Additionally, here some additional features I plan to add. Sidenote: I say I plan to add them, but I might get bored and not do it. It'll be a surprise for all of us.

- Persist high score through local storage
- About modal?
- allow user to customize the the game speed delay
- allow user to turn off increasing speed
- New colors or theme
- Pause Feature
- mobile controls
  - start button on screen
  - swipe to control it
